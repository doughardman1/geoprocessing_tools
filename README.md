## Geoprocessing Things
- Scripts I've written for various geoprocessing tasks
- Use GDAL in a clean Conda environment for ease

## To do:
- the plan is to build up a collection of useful scripts to help with tasks for processing spatial data probably relating to flood risk

## Wiki
- Head to the github wiki for my notes on useful and relevant stuff
